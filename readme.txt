Dear Whomever,

Thank you for taking the time to download this game. I hope you enjoy it.
While this may appear to be a tetris clone at a glance, I encourage you to try it... 
it is considerably harder and some have claimed "impossible" on the harder settings.

Known issues:
-Floating block after 'popping' a set beneath it -- this is NOT a bug.

Things that could be better:
-Block rotation logic.. would like to have it so that, when you rotate 'into' another block, it will let you and shift the block appropriately (provided there's room.)
-Adding order to menus outside of python's mysterious dictionary ordering.
-Add soundtrack.


Controls:
- Move pieces with arrow keys ('up' will drop)
- Rotate using left 'control' and 'alt' buttons
- 'Space' to pause the game
