BlockHaus
=========

WARNING:  This is NOT Tetris.  Playing it as such will result in disappointment.

-------------------

Controls:
- Move pieces with arrow keys ('up' will drop)
- Rotate using left 'control' and 'alt' buttons
- 'Space' to pause the game

Known issues:
-Floating block after 'popping' a set beneath it -- this is NOT a bug.

Things that could be better:
-Block rotation logic.. would like to have it so that, when you rotate 'into' another block, it will let you and shift the block appropriately (provided there's room.)
-Adding order to menus outside of python's mysterious dictionary ordering.
-Add soundtrack.
